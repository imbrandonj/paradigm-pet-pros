                    Birds are very intriguing creatures as they can range from birds as small as a Cuban bee hummingbird (about two inches long and a little over 1/20 of an ounce) to as large as an ostrich.

                    While most birds fly, there are some that don't.<br>
                    Birds are amazing and each breed is unique in its own way, particularly when it comes to their relational needs and well-being.

                    Unfortunately, birds can experience sadness and depression just like humans. A number of root causes may be responsible for your bird's depression such as an illness (either physical or mental), losing its companion, or increasingly becoming bored.<br>

            <div class="category alignC">
                <p>
                    Some signs to help identify if your bird is experiencing depression may include the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>reduced appetite</li>
                        <li>becoming increasingly irritable</li>
                        <li>aggressive behavior</li>
                        <li>songs that have a different, more solemn tone</li>
                    </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="category alignC">
                <p>
                    Be sure to tell your veterinarian if you see signs of any of these symptoms.<br> Just like many illnesses, identifying and treating the symptoms earlier may drastically increase the lifespan of your birdie.
